# Computer Infrastructure Assessment


## Problem 1: Data from yfinance

This project uses the `yfinance` library to download hourly stock data for the last five days for the five FAANG companies:

- Facebook (META)
- Apple (AAPL)
- Amazon (AMZN)
- Netflix (NFLX)
- Google (GOOG)

The data is saved as a .csv file inside a `data` folder in the project directory.<br>
Each file is named using a timestamp format:<br>
`YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.csv` (e.g. `20251022_221515.csv`), ensuring a unique filename every time the script runs.


### Tools and Libaries:

`yfinance` - downloads historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.<br>
`pandas` - manages and saves the downloaded data.<br>
`os` - manages folders and file paths.<br>
`datetime` - creates formatted timestamps for filenames.<br>


### What the Script Does:

1. Defines a list of FAANG stock tickers.
2. Downloads hourly data for the last five days using `yfinance`.
3. Displays the first few rows to confirm successful download.
4. Checks if a `data` folder exists (and prints a message if not).
5. Creates a timestamped filename in the required format.
6. Saves the dataset as a `.csv` file in the `data` folder.


### Timezone Handling:

Since FAANG companies trade in the U.S., Yahoo Finance provides timestamps in America/New_York time.<br>
To align with Irish local time, the script performs the following steps:
- Checks if the dataset includes timezone information.
- Localises the data to America/New_York (the stock exchange timezone).
- Converts the timestamps to my local timezone (Europe/Dublin).
- Verifies the conversion by printing the timezone.


### Learning Path:

This task helped me understand how to:
- Combine multiple Python libraries in one workflow.
- Automate data downloads and save them efficiently.
- Handle folders, file paths, and handle date formats + creating timestamps.
- Debug VS Code and GitHub sync issues with packages and environments.
- Work with timezones in pandas, including localising and converting between them.

Each run of the program creates a new, timestamped CSV of FAANG stock data.


## Problem 2: Plotting Data

This part of the project uses the latest CSV file created in **Problem 1** to plot the Close prices for the five FAANG companies on a single line chart.

The script looks inside the data folder, finds the most recently modified `.csv` file (e.g. `20251129_141725.csv`), loads it with pandas, and selects only the Close prices for each stock.

The resulting plot is saved as a `.png` file called `faang_close_prices.png` inside a plots folder in the project directory. If the plots folder does not exist, it is created automatically.

### Tools and Libaries:

Same as for Problem 1, including also `matplotlib` which creates a plot and saves it as an image.

### What the script does:

- Lists all files inside the data folder using `os.listdir()`.
- Filters this list so that only `.csv` files are kept.
- Builds full paths to each `CSV` file and picks the most recently modified one using `os.path.getmtime()`.
- Loads the chosen `CSV` into a pandas DataFrame with MultiIndex columns.
- Uses pandas indexing to select only the `Close` prices for all FAANG tickers.
- Flattens the column structure so the DataFrame columns become just the ticker symbols (META, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG).
- Plots each ticker’s `Close` price over time on the same graph using matplotlib.
- Adds a title, axis labels, a legend, and a grid to make the plot easier to read.
- Checks if a `plots` folder exists, and creates it if it doesn’t.
- Saves the final plot as `faang_close_prices.png` inside the `plots` folder.
